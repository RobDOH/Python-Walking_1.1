# Python-Walking_1.1
 This python code walking image with a background. CSCI 1511 introduces basic concepts of game design and programming. I learnt the Python programming language constructs to write programs that integrate classes, class methods, and class instances, built upon basic structures such as: input method handling, 2D sprite manipulation and animation, collision detection, game physics and basic artificial intelligence.
